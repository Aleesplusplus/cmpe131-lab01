I believe itâ€™s important to use branches as a software engineer. Software engineers often need access to projects in order to test and implement strategies on their own accounts. The challenge, however, is that these projects usually require significant collaboration with multiple engineers. In these situations, edits made by one engineer on the original project may differ from what others need, which can cause conflicts.So, using branches, a software engineer can make edits independently, then push those changes out for review before committing them to the main project. This process helps prevent conflicts, ensures everyone stays on the same page, and keeps all changes trackable.
